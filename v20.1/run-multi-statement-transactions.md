This page has instructions for making SQL [selection queries][selection] against CockroachDB from various programming languages.

The instructions assume that you have already:

- Set up a running cluster using the instructions for a [manual deployment][manual] or an [orchestrated deployment][orchestrated].
- [Connected to the database](connect-to-the-database.html).
- [Inserted data](insert-data.html) that you now want to run queries against.

## SQL

For more information about how to use the built-in SQL client, see the [`cockroach sql`](cockroach-sql.html) reference docs.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;
DELETE orders WHERE customer = 1;
COMMIT;

## Go

The best way to run a multi-statement transaction is to use the [`crdb` transaction wrapper](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-go/tree/master/crdb) which automatically handles transaction retries if they occur.

For complete examples showing how to use it, see [Build a Go App with CockroachDB](build-a-go-app-with-cockroachdb.html).

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="java">

## Java

The best way to run a multi-statement transaction from Java is to write a wrapper method that automatically handles transaction retries.

For complete examples showing how to write and use such wrapper methods, see [Build a Java App with CockroachDB](build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb.html).

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="python">

## Python

The best way to run a multi-statement transaction from Python is to write a wrapper function that automatically handles transaction retries.

For complete examples showing how to write and use such wrapper functions, see [Build a Python App with CockroachDB](build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb.html).
